Information Systems Research (ISR) plays a pivotal role in understanding the integration of technology within organizations. The evolving landscape of digital transformation requires researchers to explore how information systems can enhance organizational performance. ISR investigates the design, implementation, and impact of information systems, focusing on the strategic alignment between IT and business objectives. As organizations adopt innovative technologies, researchers examine how these systems facilitate decision-making processes, improve operational efficiency, and drive competitive advantage. Through empirical studies and theoretical frameworks, ISR contributes to the knowledge base, guiding practitioners in effectively leveraging technology to achieve their goals.
