The impact of cloud computing on information systems is another vital topic in Information Systems Research. As organizations increasingly migrate to cloud-based solutions, researchers investigate the implications for system architecture, data security, and service delivery. ISR explores the benefits of scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness that cloud computing offers to businesses. Additionally, studies focus on the challenges associated with cloud adoption, including vendor lock-in, compliance issues, and the need for robust governance frameworks. By examining case studies and developing theoretical models, ISR provides valuable insights that help organizations navigate the complexities of cloud integration and maximize their investment in cloud technologies.
